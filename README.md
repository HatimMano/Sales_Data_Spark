# Sales Data Analysis with Apache Spark

This project utilizes Apache Spark to perform an analysis of sales data from a fictional company. The goal is to extract useful insights from the data and present the findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Project Structure

- `sales.py`: The main script for sales data analysis.
- `sales_data.csv`: The CSV file containing sales data.
- `results/`: The directory containing analysis results (plots, reports, etc.). (Coming Soon)

## Usage

1. Run the `sales.py` script to initiate the sales data analysis.
2. Explore the generated results in the `results` directory.
